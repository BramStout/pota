ROADMAP:
	
	1.2:
		htoa focus distance in meters?.. maybe arnold is doing something odd with the translation of aiFocusDistance?
		c4dtoa
		wideangle: 14mm -> 22 mm
		fisheye focus is off, is this because of the lens offset?
		double_gauss: 103mm, look up what this is supposed to be
		brute force logarithmic infinity search not working
		calculate accurate infinity focus before lens generation
		compute focal length before lens generation so I can properly match the lenses
		fix clipping, not sure why but pota's is closer than the perspective camera by a factor of 10

	2.0:
		add bidirectional sampling (aov shader)
		aov shader not working on windows? Check differences
		fix nans of double gauss angenieux (aov shader)

		implement ray-reverse function to support viewport tessellation, adaptive subdivision, etc


	2.1:
		bidirectional: check for intersections along P->Lens path
		bidirectional: come up with better triggering of backtracing, based on sample intensity, distance from focal point, fstop, ..?


	2.2:
		add support for x and y cylinders for newer anamorphic lenses
	
	
.. always add more lens descriptions
