BASE RELEASE:

	compile and package for windows and osx
	render comparison image
	add and test magic number
	[fisheye, fisheye_aspherical] crashes, check number output
	is focusing optimal..?
	wideangle isnâ€™t focusing
	.mtd for sample_bokeh
	figure out why trying to shoot ray multiple times degrades image sampling


POINT RELEASES:
	
	fix nans of double gauss angenieux
	check for intersections along P->Lens path
	come up with better triggering of backtracing, based on sample intensity, distance from focal point, fstop, ..?
	implement ray-reverse function to support viewport tessellation, adaptive subdivision, etc
	investigate fitted polynomial speed, fit lenses with lower coefficients/terms?
	add more lens descriptions (different focal lengths)
	add frame numbering to aov shader
