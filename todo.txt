BASE RELEASE:

	compile and package for windows and osx
	render comparison image
	.mtd for sample_bokeh
	sample_bokeh not working on windows? Check differences
	why are the infinity focuses so off?
	previous focus made nicer bokeh with petzval.. Why?


POINT RELEASES:
	figure out why trying to shoot ray multiple times degrades image sampling
	fix nans of double gauss angenieux
	check for intersections along P->Lens path
	come up with better triggering of backtracing, based on sample intensity, distance from focal point, fstop, ..?
	implement ray-reverse function to support viewport tessellation, adaptive subdivision, etc
	investigate fitted polynomial speed, fit lenses with lower coefficients/terms?
	add more lens descriptions (different focal lengths)
	add frame numbering to aov shader
	fix clipping, not sure why but pota's is closer than the perspective camera by a factor of 10
