BASE RELEASE:

	compile and package for windows and osx
	render comparison image
	.mtd for sample_bokeh
	figure out why trying to shoot ray multiple times degrades image sampling
	why are the infinity focuses so off?
	fix clipping, not sure why but pota's is closer than the perspective camera by a factor of 10


POINT RELEASES:
	
	fix nans of double gauss angenieux
	check for intersections along P->Lens path
	come up with better triggering of backtracing, based on sample intensity, distance from focal point, fstop, ..?
	implement ray-reverse function to support viewport tessellation, adaptive subdivision, etc
	investigate fitted polynomial speed, fit lenses with lower coefficients/terms?
	add more lens descriptions (different focal lengths)
	add frame numbering to aov shader
