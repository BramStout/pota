BASE RELEASE:

	compile and package for windows and osx
	render comparison image
	sample_bokeh not working on windows? Check differences

	brute force logarithmic infinity search not working

	calculate accurate infinity focus before lens generation
	compute focal length before lens generation so I can properly match the lenses

	wideangle: 14mm -> 22 mm

	fisheye focus is off, is this because of the lens offset?

	petzval: 66mm, look up what this is supposed to be
	double_gauss: 103mm



POINT RELEASES:

	add support for x and y cylinders for newer anamorphic lenses
	fix nans of double gauss angenieux
	check for intersections along P->Lens path
	come up with better triggering of backtracing, based on sample intensity, distance from focal point, fstop, ..?
	implement ray-reverse function to support viewport tessellation, adaptive subdivision, etc
	add more lens descriptions (different focal lengths)
	fix clipping, not sure why but pota's is closer than the perspective camera by a factor of 10
